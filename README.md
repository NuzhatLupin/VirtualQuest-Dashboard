# VirtualQuest-Dashboard


## Overview
The VirtueQuest Dashboard is a Python project developed by an interdisciplinary team consisting of Nusrat Atika, Ellis Dyke, and Nuzhat Zahan. This project aims to provide users with a user-friendly web interface for accessing various tools and information. It utilizes cutting-edge technologies and APIs to offer a seamless experience.

## Project Description
The VirtueQuest Dashboard offers functionalities such as a Python calculator, Wikipedia search, and internet search using DuckDuckGo. Leveraging the panel library, the interface is interactive and intuitive, catering to users with varying levels of technical expertise.
